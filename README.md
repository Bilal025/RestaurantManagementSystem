# Restaurant Management System

I am currently in the process of developing a Cafe Management System that will simplify the order creation process for cafes and provide customers with a seamless experience. This ongoing project includes user roles for Admins and Customers, efficient category and product management, automated billing, and the ability to download and print bills.

**The source code will upload soon...**

**Admin Features:**

* Category and Product Management: Admins can manage categories, products, and their details to keep the menu up-to-date.
* User Management: Admins have control over user accounts, granting access and managing roles.
* Order Management: Admins can oversee and update orders for efficient cafe operations.

**Customer Features:**

* Order Creation: Customers can create orders by selecting items from the menu.
* Generated Bills: Upon order creation, the system generates a bill that can be downloaded and printed for reference.

**Technologies**

* Backend: Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, MySQL, Spring Security, REST API.
* Frontend: Angular, Bootstrap styling.
* Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for securing API endpoints.

**Project Progress**

* This project is currently under development, with ongoing work to create the following features:
* A user-friendly landing page for customers to create orders.
* A role-based system with two user categories: Admin and Customer.
* Order processing capabilities for both users.
* Automatic bill generation upon order creation.
